Get-Eve-Market
==============

Scripts to get Eve market data for a list of IDs

The scripts parse a text file containing VALID eve IDs, 
and fetches the eve-central market data for them in batches of 40.

Then it merges the resulting eve-central XML files into a single XML. 

I use it in Excel (not included)
